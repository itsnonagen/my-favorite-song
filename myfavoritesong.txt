Beautiful in My Eyes
Song by Joshua Kadison

Lyrics
You're my piece of mind,
in this crazy world.
Your're everything I've tried to find,
your love is a pearl.
You're my Mona Lisa, you're my rainbow skies,
and my only prayer, is that you realize,
you'll always be beautiful, in my eyes.
The world will turn,
and the seasons will change.
And all the lessons we will learn,
will be beautiful and strange.
We'll have our fill of tears, our share of sighs.
My only prayer, is that you realize.
You'll always be beautiful, in my eyes.
You will always be, beautiful in my eyes.
And the passing years will show,
that you will always grow,
evermore beautiful, in my eyes.
And there are lines upon my face,
from a lifetime of smiles.
But when the time comes to embrace.
for one long last while.
We can laugh about it, how time really flies.
We won't say goodbye, 'cause true-love never dies.
You'll always be beautiful, in my eyes.
You will always be, beautiful in my eyes.
And the passing years will show,
that you will always grow,
evermore beautiful, in my eyes.
The passing years will show,
that you will always grow,
evermore beautiful, in my eyes.
